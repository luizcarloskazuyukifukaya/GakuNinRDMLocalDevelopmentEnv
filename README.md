# GakuNin RDM Development Setup Scripts
This repository is for the management of script to setup the local GakuNin RDM
development Environment with Ubuntu 22.04

The official development guide is provided from NII, so you should follow the
instructions described there.
But for some steps, there may be an issue, and this repository was created to
put all findings and workaround to overcome them. It may be environment
dependent, so for now, it is just for internal memo.
